This document provides a brief overview of the MATLAB program used for widefield microscopy image processing and analysis in th article “Imaging small molecule-induced endosomal escape of siRNA” by Du Rietz et al. submitted to <i>Nature Communications</i> 23 September 2019.
 
The code is available for review as source code. A small dataset to demo the object tracking and data analysis is available through …
 
1. System requirements
MATLAB 2018 (backward compatibility not evaluated)
Windows 7 or 10, Mac OS.
Fiji 1.52n for image visualization

   No special hardware is used for the object analysis.
 
2. Installation guide
The program does not require any additional installation. The source code should be placed in a directory with the corresponding path on the computer hard drive /homefolder/Processing tools/Matlab. After running the application, under the setup tab, enter the path of the homefolder directory.
 
3. Demo
A separate manual with instructions for using the program is supplied separately, including demo. Expected output data from object tracking is object intensity. Run time for each step of the demo is typically <2 min.
 
4. Instructions for use
Please refer to the program manual for detailed instructions.
